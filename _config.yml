  job: Hi I'm Si Ying!
  bio: |+
    <br />
    I'm currently a fresh graduate from NUS Business School with a Specialisation in Business Analytics and Second Major in Economics.
    <br />
    <br />
    I have a keen interest in using analytics to derive meaningful insights from big data to aid business functions. 
    As a motivated and driven individual, I enjoy working in dynamic environments and challenging myself to grow beyond my potential. 
    With a strong desire to learn, I'm always open to new experiences.
